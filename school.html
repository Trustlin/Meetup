    <p>My name is Esosuakpo Trust. I loved learning new things and i think programming provide me a platform
        to learn more.<br>
            NITDA accepted my application for the study of BLOCKCHAIN Development. <br>I was very
                happy and determined to do my best to make it a success.<br>
